Introduction
The Study Journal is a personalised note-taking web application designed to address the challenges of keeping track of learning progress and new skills development. As a constant learner and enthusiast for self-improvement, I often found myself struggling to maintain organised notes and retain newly acquired knowledge. While relying on memory served its purpose, the rapid pace of learning and diverse skill acquisition necessitated a more efficient solution.

Motivation
In a world filled with various note-taking platforms and tools, I wanted to create a solution tailored to my needs â€“ one that not only allowed me to jot down thoughts but also offered a platform for honing my web development skills. The Study Journal was born out of the necessity to:

Sharpen Web Development Skills: Utilise HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct a functional web application, thereby reinforcing core programming concepts. It is still a work in progress and I will be updating regularly stay in tune!
